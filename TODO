got:
- Teach 'got merge' to merge changes into an arbitrary subdirectory
  of the work tree. This would be nice for merging vendor branches.
  Say you have a branch 'llvm-12' which intially contains a 12.0
  release tree as published by the LLVM project, added to the repository
  with a command such as 'got import -b llvm-12'. On the main branch we
  would want to merge files from the llvm-12 branch into /usr/src/gnu/llvm
  instead of the root directory checked out at /usr/src.
  The next LLVM release 12.1 would later be committed onto the llvm-12
  branch and then merged into main at /usr/src/gnu/llvm in the same way.

libexec:
- add http(s) transport with libtls in dial.c, speaking Git's HTTP protocol
  via got-fetch-pack or a new helper

tog:
- implement 'limit' for 'tog log' (like search but display matched commits only)

gotweb:
- tracey has a gotwebd thingy in progress somewhere

gotd:
- needs to be designed and implemented
