got:
- Teach 'got merge' to merge changes into an arbitrary subdirectory
  of the work tree. This would be nice for merging vendor branches.
  Say you have a branch 'llvm-12' which intially contains a 12.0
  release tree as published by the LLVM project, added to the repository
  with a command such as 'got import -b llvm-12'. On the main branch we
  would want to merge files from the llvm-12 branch into /usr/src/gnu/llvm
  instead of the root directory checked out at /usr/src.
  The next LLVM release 12.1 would later be committed onto the llvm-12
  branch and then merged into main at /usr/src/gnu/llvm in the same way.
- Improve distinction between author and committer meta-data:
  - When creating commits honor GOT_AUTHOR as the default value for both
    fields, with an option to override the 'author ' field in the commit
    object (displayed as 'from: ' in got log) with a name + email-address.
    Careful, Git requires an email address and will *fail to parse* commit
    objects otherwise.
  - When rebasing/histediting commits, we could keep the original 'author'
    field intact but reset the 'committer' field to the value of GOT_AUTHOR.
- Add an option where 'got cherrypick' and 'got backout' will immediately
  create a new commit with a log-message based on the original log message.
  This must require an up-to-date and clean work tree to avoid unrelated
  changes from getting mixed in. Perform an implicit work tree base-commit
  bump after committing, like 'got rebase' and 'got histedit' do it.

network protocol:
- add http(s) transport with libtls, speaking the two Git HTTP protocols
  (both "dumb" and "smart" need to work) via got-fetch-pack, or a new helper
  like got-fetch-http; it is fine if HTTP remains a fetch-only protocol, and
  works only against servers which don't require authentication for fetches;
  anything beyond this would require a full-featured HTTP client (Git uses
  libcurl, which we cannot use as it is not in the OpenBSD base system)

tog:
- implement 'limit' for 'tog log' (like search but display matched commits only)
- make 'tog log' respond to key presses while 'loading...' history; loading
  can be slow for paths in a deep history if the path has not been changed
  very often, and 'tog log' blocks far too long in this case
- make it possible to view the contents of tag objects
- verify signed tag objects
- add a toggle to switch between display of author/committer in the log view

gotweb:
- tracey has a gotwebd thingy in progress somewhere

gotd:
- needs to be designed and implemented
