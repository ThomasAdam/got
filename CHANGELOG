Got-portable Changelog
======================

This file details portable-specific changes to make things work on systems
other than OpenBSD.

All changes are on top of the versioned changes listed in CHANGES.

# got-portable-0.75.1 (2022-09-13)

This is a bug-fix -portable release to address the following:

* portable: macos: look for GNU Bison in more places, based on whether brew or
  MacPorts is in use, and failing to find Bison that way, look in a few
  hard-coded but likely locations.
* portable: remove compat sys/queue.h -- this now makes libbsd a core
  dependency on those systems which require it.

# got-portable 0.75 (2022-09-10)

* portable: import gotwebd
* portable: improve <sys/queue.h> inclusion
* portable: portably wrap socket functions between BSDs/Linux
* portable: improve homebrew support for MacOS

# got-portable 0.74 (2022-07-14)

* portable: made the 'date' command more portable in the test suite.
* portable: improved error-handling for commands on BSD-systems without
  coreutils being installed.
* portable: reworked how 'sed' is wrapped portably, so that it now doesn't use
  any bashisms, and will therefore run under strict POSIX-sh (dash on Ubuntu,
  for instance).

# got-portable 0.73 (2022-07-04)

* Changes as found in got-0.73.
* portable: the libexec helpers now support Capsicum on FreeBSD, which is
  similar to OpenBSD's pledge() syscall.
* Some portable work has taken place, but these have been merged upstream and
  hence will be in the got-0.73 changes file.

# got-portable 0.71 (2022-06-23)

* portable: fix cross-compilation, from Leah Neukirchen

# got-portable 0.70 (2022-05-13)

* Changes from got-0.70; no -portable specific changes worth mentioning.

# got-portable 0.69 (2022-04-24)

* portable: added Apline Linux to the core set of OSes when checking CI/CD -
  this therefore implies -portable can build on muscl as well as glibc.
* portable: fixed compilation of -portable on Alpine Linux with respect to
  Landlock by using the correct header file.
* portable: added SipHash as a -portable implementation.

# got-portable 0.68.1 (2022-03-22)

* portable: fix up a bad merge whereby a code block that should have been
  removed was left in-situ.

# got-portable 0.68 (2022-03-22)

* Changes from got-0.68
* portable: support for the following operating systems:
  - FreeBSD
  - NetBSD
  - DragonFlyBSD
  - MacOS

# got-portable 0.67; (2022-02-20)

* Changes from got-0.66

  is similar to unveil(), allowing restrictions to which part of the
  filesystem a process can access.

# got-portable 0.66; (2022-01-12)

* Changes from got-0.65

# got-portable 0.65; (2022-01-06)

# got-portable 0.61; (2021-10-09)
